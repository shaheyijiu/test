Rigid means the relative position among object components do not change. For instance, a cup, a book and a car are rigid object while a human face and a cat are non-rigid object. It has a variety of uses, some of which are: humancomputer interaction, security and surveillance, video communicationand compression, augmented reality, traffic control, medical imaging and video editing. 3D object tracking can be especially difficult when the objects are moving fast relative to the frame rate. Another situation that increases the complexity of the problem is when the tracked object changes orientation over time. For these situations the tracking system usually employs a motion model which describes how the image of the target might change for different possible motions of the object.  \r\n##Please refer to the following videos to better under what is 3D object tracking:  \r\n<p>暂时展示一个旅游视频</p>\r\n<iframe height=498 width=510 src=\"http://player.youku.com/embed/XMTU2Njk3NzQ3Ng==\" frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n##You can refer to but not limited to the following references\r\n* Multiple 3D Object Tracking for Augmented Reality, In ISMAR, 2008.  \r\n* [https://www.ssontech.com/tutes/tuteobj.html](https://www.ssontech.com/tutes/tuteobj.html)   \r\n* Manipulator and Object Tracking for In-Hand 3D Object Modeling, IN IJRR, 2011.  \r\n* Robust Statistics for 3D Object Tracking, In ICRA 2006.  \r\n* Real-time 3D Object Pose Estimation and Tracking for Natural Landmark Based Visual Servo.
